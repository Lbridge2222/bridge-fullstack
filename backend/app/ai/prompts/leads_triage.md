Instructions:
- Given a JSON array of lead feature objects, return a JSON list of items:
  [{"id": string, "score": number, "reasons": string[], "next_action": string}]
- "score" must be 0-100. Use deterministic features when possible; keep reasoning concise.
- Favor: high lead_score, recent engagement. Penalize: no recent activity.
- Limit reasons to <= 3 per item. next_action one of [follow_up, book_interview, nurture].

Respond with ONLY valid JSON.
