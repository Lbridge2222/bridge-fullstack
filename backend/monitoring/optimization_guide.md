# RAG Performance Optimization Guide

## Current Performance
- Average: 2.64s
- 70% compliance with 1-3s range
- 30% of queries exceed 3s

## ðŸš€ Optimization Strategies

### 1. Immediate Optimizations (Quick Wins)

#### A. Vector Search Optimization
```python
# In your RAG implementation, optimize vector search:
- Increase batch size for vector operations
- Use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
- Implement query result caching
- Pre-compute embeddings for common queries
```

#### B. LLM Response Optimization
```python
# Optimize LLM calls:
- Reduce max_tokens for faster generation
- Use streaming responses
- Implement response caching
- Use faster models for simple queries
```

#### C. Database Query Optimization
```python
# Optimize knowledge base queries:
- Add database indexes
- Use connection pooling
- Implement query result caching
- Optimize SQL queries
```

### 2. Architecture Optimizations

#### A. Caching Strategy
```python
# Multi-level caching:
1. Query-level caching (Redis)
2. Embedding caching
3. Response caching
4. Knowledge base caching
```

#### B. Async Processing
```python
# Parallel processing:
- Parallel vector searches
- Async LLM calls
- Concurrent database queries
- Background processing for heavy operations
```

#### C. Model Optimization
```python
# Model selection:
- Use smaller, faster models for simple queries
- Implement query classification
- Route complex queries to larger models
- Use model quantization
```

### 3. Infrastructure Optimizations

#### A. Database Optimization
```sql
-- Add indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_knowledge_content ON knowledge_base USING gin(to_tsvector('english', content));
CREATE INDEX idx_knowledge_category ON knowledge_base(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_knowledge_created_at ON knowledge_base(created_at);
```

#### B. Vector Database
```python
# Consider dedicated vector database:
- Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant
- Optimized for vector operations
- Better performance than PostgreSQL
```

#### C. CDN and Caching
```python
# Content delivery:
- CDN for static content
- Edge caching for common queries
- Geographic distribution
```

### 4. Monitoring and Profiling

#### A. Performance Profiling
```python
# Add detailed timing:
- Vector search time
- LLM generation time
- Database query time
- Total response time
```

#### B. Query Analysis
```python
# Analyze slow queries:
- Identify patterns
- Optimize common slow queries
- Implement query-specific optimizations
```
