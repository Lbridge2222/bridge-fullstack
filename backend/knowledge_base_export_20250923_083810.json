While developed for B2B, its principles map cleanly onto HE admissions: applicants face high stakes, multiple influencers (parents, teachers), and complex decision factors (finance, location, career outcomes).\n\n**Framework**\n- **Teach**: Offer a surprising, data-backed insight. In HE this often means showing applicants graduate outcomes data (IFS, LEO, Discover Uni) that reframes their understanding of ROI.\n- **Tailor**: Connect the insight to their personal goals. E.g. an applicant wants to study law; you show comparative salary and employment rates between providers and course types.\n- **Take Control**: Drive next steps with confidence. Set interview dates, explain UCAS deadlines, and position urgency not as pressure but as fairness (\"the earlier you apply, the more choice you keep open\").\n\n**Scripts**\n- Teach: \"Most applicants assume all degrees in economics have the same outcomes. In reality, data shows Russell Group universities deliver significantly different career trajectories within 6 months of graduation.\"\n- Tailor: \"You've told me your dream is to work in public policy. Let me show you alumni case studies from political science programmes and their job roles.\"\n- Take Control: \"UCAS equal consideration closes in January — let's secure your interview this week so you're well positioned.\"\n\n**Pitfalls**\n- Over-teaching (information dump with no personal link).\n- Tailoring only on superficial aspects (location, social life).\n- Taking control as pressure (\"sign today or lose out\") rather than professional guidance.\n\n**Next Steps**\n- Train advisors to prep one \"teaching insight\" per call/email, backed by real data.\n- Embed a Challenger checklist in CRM call notes.\n- Review success rates monthly to refine teaching insights.",

      "content": "**What You Know:**\n- Deferred entry means applying now, but starting the course a year later. Most universities allow deferral by one year; it's up to the provider to agree.\n- Even with deferral, offer conditions (e.g. grade requirements) must still be met in the year of application.\n\n**Ask:**\n- **Ask:** 'Is your reason for deferral pre-planned (e.g. work, travel) or something that might arise later?'\n- **Ask:** 'Have you checked whether your chosen university/course accepts deferral?'\n\n**Say:**\n- **Say:** 'Deferral does not change the conditions of your offer.'\n- **Say:** 'Make the deferral request based on your university's official policy.'\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Identify whether each of your universities allows deferral for the specific course.\n- Prepare the deferral request early; understand the paperwork and deadlines.",
