## ✅ **Conversation History Fixed**

### **Problem Identified:**
- Complex de-duplication logic was preventing responses from being added to conversation
- RAG response state management was causing conversation to be overwritten
- Messages were being cleared instead of preserved per session

### **Solution Applied:**

1. **Removed Complex De-duplication**
   - Eliminated the hash-based de-duplication that was blocking responses
   - Simplified RAG response handling to always add responses to conversation

2. **Fixed Conversation Persistence**
   - Removed `setMessages([])` from dialog close handler
   - Conversation history now persists throughout the session
   - Only clears when user manually clicks trash icon

3. **Simplified Response Flow**
   - User question → Added to conversation
   - AI response → Added to conversation  
   - Repeat → Previous conversation preserved

### **Result:**
- ✅ Conversation history persists per session
- ✅ No more overwriting of previous messages
- ✅ Each question and answer is preserved
- ✅ Manual clear option still available
- ✅ Application IDs removed from responses

The Ask Ivy dialog now behaves like a proper chat interface with persistent conversation history!
