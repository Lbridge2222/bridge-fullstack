- Verify backend logs for model loading issues
- Test endpoints individually with curl
- Check console logs for real data being sent to triage

## 🔬 Techniques to Borrow from Forecast Development Scripts (Additive Guidance)

This section distills production-hardened techniques from `Forecast Development/PythonCodeForecast` (e.g., `load_XGB_Forecast_Pipeline_V7.py`, `load_XGB_Forecast_Offers_V2.py`, `load_XGB_Forecast_accepts_V2.py`, `load_Lead_Forecast_V2.py`) and maps them to Bridge CRM’s Predictive Intelligence layer.

### What’s worth borrowing (and why)
- Advanced feature engineering for forecasts
  - Lag features: weekly lags (1,2,4,8,12,26,52)
  - Rolling windows: 4w/8w/12w rolling means
  - Growth rates with clipping to avoid infinities
  - Seasonality embeddings: month sin/cos, academic week, academic phase flags
  - Practical trend proxy: normalized time index
- Robust data hygiene
  - Gap filling on weekly time series (forward/backward fill) to avoid data loss
  - Numeric-only feature selection and safe type handling
- Confidence intervals that behave in practice
  - Use model disagreement (ensemble std) for realistic intervals instead of unstable bootstraps
- Ensembles for stability (and explainability)
  - XGBoost + LightGBM + RandomForest with soft-voting ensemble for smoother forecasts
  - Keep individual model scores for diagnostics; ensemble for serving
- Distribution and rounding patterns (if/when you forecast breakdowns)
  - Smart rounding that matches totals without bias
  - Pre-thresholding small cells (e.g., <0.3) before rounding to eliminate noise
- Database-safe IO patterns (if persisting)
  - Idempotent “swap-in via staging table” (create _stg, swap, drop old)
  - SQLAlchemy 2.0 compatible writes with psycopg2 fallback
  - Accuracy logging scaffolding for future backtesting

### How these map to Bridge CRM
- Phase 2.1/2.4 (Lead-level micro-forecast):
  - Borrow feature engineering patterns (seasonality, engagement lags) as lead-level features
  - Replace rules-only ETA with ensemble-informed ETA
  - Adopt “model disagreement” CIs for forecast confidence in UI
- Source Quality Analytics (2.2):
  - Use seasonality features to de-noise channel performance and improve trend detection
- Future “breakdown” use cases (course/campus or program stacks):
  - Use threshold + smart rounding for any matrix outputs shown to users
- MLOps posture (without adding tables):
  - Keep training offline/scheduled; serve predictions via existing endpoints
  - If/when we persist: reuse staging-swap pattern; otherwise remain stateless

### Minimal, safe integration plan (no schema changes required)
1) Feature layer (backend, shared across 2.1/2.4):
   - Add util to compute: month_sin/cos, academic_week, academic_phase flags, time_index, engagement rolling/growth
   - Guard rails: numeric-only, inf/NaN sanitization
2) Confidence intervals:
   - Start with disagreement proxy (even with two models: rules + ML) → simple, stable CIs
3) Ensemble (optional, behind flag):
   - XGBoost + LightGBM + RandomForest; soft-voting
   - Fallback to logistic/regression if GPU/CPU is constrained
4) Evaluation hooks (optional, no new tables):
   - Log to JSON file; push to db later via staging-swap if desired

### Dependencies (optional, gated)
- Core: scikit-learn, pandas
- Optional: xgboost, lightgbm (feature-flagged)
- Do not introduce NeuralProphet unless needed; keep runtime lean for the API path

### Implementation notes
- Keep models out of request path for training. Train offline; load artifacts in memory for serving
- Preserve current API shapes; add CI fields and feature_importance incrementally
- Respect user preferences: avoid new tables; if persistence becomes necessary, use staging-swap
