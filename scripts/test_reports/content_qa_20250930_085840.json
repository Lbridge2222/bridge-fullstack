First, it is important to determine the level of study Ryan is applying for (undergraduate or postgraduate). The university's admissions policy aims to reflect sector-best practice and covers all levels of study. If Ryan is using non-standard or overseas qualifications, it is recommended to contact admissions to check equivalency rules. Universities consider applications on an individual basis. Meeting the entry requirements does not guarantee an offer due to competition. Ryan's subject combinations, retakes (if any), and overall academic record will be taken into consideration. Next Steps: \n1. Inquire whether Ryan is applying for undergraduate or postgraduate study.\n\n2. Ask if Ryan requires equivalency or recognition of overseas qualifications. \n3. Find out if Ryan needs to retake any subjects and whether the retake policy is acceptable for the chosen course.\n\n4. Check if Ryan's current subject combination aligns with the prerequisites listed in the course descriptions. \n5. Contact admissions to check equivalency rules if Ryan is using non-standard or overseas qualifications. For MA Music Performance, APEL could be relevant if you have significant experience in the field that hasn't been formally certified.
