However, universities also consider a student's personal statement, references, and sometimes admissions tests or interviews to get a fuller picture of their abilities. **Guidance Sources:** **UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service):** UCAS provides comprehensive information on the UK university application process, including details on how predicted grades are used and the different factors universities consider.",
