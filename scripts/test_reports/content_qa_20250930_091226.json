Also, it advises confirming whether the university permits non-standard entry based on experience. * Next steps include reviewing the university's policy for the applicant's level/subject and contacting admissions to check equivalency rules if using non-standard or overseas qualifications. \n2. **Admissions Policy Alignment & Good Practice** (Similarity score: \n0.625363060302628) * This document emphasizes the university's commitment to a fair and transparent admissions service, aligning with the UUK/GuildHE Fair Admissions Code. * It recommends verifying the course page for up-to-date information and checking the policy on subject combinations, retakes, or non-standard qualifications. * Next steps involve visiting the university's online admissions policy, verifying requirements for the subject, and double-checking the acceptability of non-standard qualifications or retakes. \n3. **Subject Combinations & Retakes Policy** (Similarity score: \n0.616604910618493) * This document indicates that universities consider applications individually, including subject combinations, retakes, and academic record. Meeting entry requirements does not guarantee an offer due to competition. * It suggests confirming the acceptability of retakes for the course and ensuring the current subject combination aligns with the prerequisites listed in the course descriptions. * Next steps include checking required subject combinations, assessing whether the retake policy is acceptable, and gathering extra achievements to strengthen the application if needed. For MA Music Performance, APEL could be relevant if you have significant experience in the field that hasn't been formally certified.
