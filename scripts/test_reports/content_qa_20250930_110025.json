Ryan should check whether his credentials align with the course requirements and whether he can use supplementary evidence if needed. * **Flexibility:** Smaller universities sometimes offer more flexibility but still expect applicants to meet baseline criteria. * **Policy review:** Ryan should review the university's policy for his level and subject of study. * **Equivalency check:** If Ryan is using non-standard or overseas qualifications, he should contact admissions to verify equivalency rules. * **Policy alignment:** Universities try to follow good sector practice; their alignment with the Fair Admissions Code is a positive sign.
