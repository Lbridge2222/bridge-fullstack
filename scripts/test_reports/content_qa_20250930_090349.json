It allows individuals to gain academic credit for skills and knowledge acquired through work or life experiences. **Key Aspects of APEL:** * **Assessment:** APEL involves a structured assessment of an individual's prior learning against the learning outcomes of a specific course or qualification. * **Evidence:** Applicants typically need to provide evidence of their learning, which may include portfolios, work samples, references, and interviews. * **Credit Transfer:** If the assessment is successful, the individual may be awarded academic credit, which can reduce the amount of time and study required to complete a formal qualification. **Relevance to Admissions:** APEL can be particularly relevant for mature students or those with extensive work experience who do not have traditional academic qualifications. It provides a pathway for them to access higher education or professional development opportunities. For MA Music Performance, APEL could be relevant if you have significant experience in the field that hasn't been formally certified.

If he's using non-standard qualifications or retakes, double-check their acceptability. *Note*: Even if Ryan hits the grades, competition means not all qualified students receive offers.
