Also, find out if he requires equivalency or recognition of overseas qualifications. * **Inquire about non-standard entry:** Ask Ryan if he knows whether the university permits non-standard entry or uses discretion based on experience. * **Advise on inclusivity and alignment:** Universities aim to be inclusive. Ryan should check whether his credentials align with the course requirements and whether he can use supplementary evidence if needed. Smaller universities may offer more flexibility but will still expect baseline criteria to be met. * **Direct Ryan to review university policy:** Ryan should review the university's admissions policy for his level and subject. If using non-standard or overseas qualifications, he should contact admissions to verify equivalency rules. * **Check course page and policy:** Verify that the university's course page is up-to-date for Ryan's desired course. Determine the university's policy on subject combinations, retakes, or non-standard qualifications. If Ryan is using non-standard qualifications or retakes, double-check their acceptability.

It suggests reviewing the university's policy for the relevant level/subject and contacting admissions to verify equivalency rules for non-standard or overseas qualifications. \n2. **Admissions Policy Alignment & Good Practice:** With a similarity score of \n0.625363060302628, this document emphasizes the importance of verifying course page accuracy and understanding the university's policy on subject combinations, retakes, or non-standard qualifications. It recommends visiting the university's online admissions policy and double-checking acceptability for non-standard qualifications or retakes. \n3. **Subject Combinations & Retakes Policy:** This document (similarity score: \n0.616604910618493) highlights that universities consider applications individually, including subject combinations, retakes, and academic record.
