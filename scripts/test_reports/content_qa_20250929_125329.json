APEL is a process of assessing and recognising what someone has already learned through experience, either in work or life, against the learning outcomes for a specific qualification or course. Here is what this person needs to know about APEL: * **Purpose**: APEL is designed to give formal recognition to skills and knowledge gained outside of formal education. This can allow individuals to gain entry to a course, gain credits towards a qualification, or gain a full qualification. * **Assessment**: The assessment process typically involves compiling a portfolio of evidence, which may include work samples, testimonials, and a reflective account of how the person's experience meets the learning outcomes of the desired qualification. An interview may also be required. * **Eligibility**: Eligibility for APEL depends on the specific institution and the qualification being sought. Generally, this person needs to demonstrate that their prior learning is relevant to the course or qualification they are applying for. * **Benefits**: APEL can save time and money by reducing the amount of study required. It can also boost this person's confidence and career prospects by providing formal recognition of their skills and knowledge. Next Steps: \n1. **Check specific requirements**: This person should check the specific APEL requirements for the course they are interested in.\n\n2. **Gather evidence**: This person should start gathering evidence of their prior learning, such as work samples, testimonials, and a reflective account of their experience. \n3. **Contact the admissions team**: This person should contact the admissions team for further guidance and support.\n\nAccreditation of Prior Experiential Learning (APEL) allows applicants' prior work/experience to be credited towards a degree.
