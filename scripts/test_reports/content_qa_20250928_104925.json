The general process involves: * **Application:** The individual applies to have their prior learning assessed. * **Assessment:** The individual provides evidence of their prior learning, which is then assessed against the learning outcomes of the course or qualification they are seeking. * **Accreditation:** If the assessment is successful, the individual is awarded credits towards the qualification or granted entry to the course. For specific requirements, \"This person\" should consult the admissions department of the institution offering the course they're interested in.
