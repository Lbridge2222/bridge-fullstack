Confirm the university publishes clear information about courses and entry requirements. \n3. **Individual Basis**: Understand that universities consider applications on an individual basis, including academic records. Meeting minimum entry requirements does not guarantee an offer due to competition. \n4. **Non-Standard Qualifications**: For non-standard qualifications, contact the admissions department to check equivalency rules.\n\n5. **Policy Review**: Review the university's policy for the relevant level and subject. Verify specific entry criteria on their site to avoid surprises. \n6. **Subject Combinations & Retakes**: Check required subject combinations and assess the acceptability of retakes, if applicable.\n\n7. **Supplementary Evidence**: Universities aim to be inclusive; check whether the candidate's credentials align and whether they can use supplementary evidence if needed. By following these steps, you can effectively assess APEL qualifications, ensuring alignment with university policies and fair admissions practices.\n\nAccreditation of Prior Experiential Learning (APEL) allows applicants' prior work/experience to be credited towards a degree.
