It encompasses equality and diversity, data protection, and consumer rights within the admissions process. 2. **Admissions Policy Alignment & Good Practice:** This document details the university's commitment to providing a fair, efficient, and professional admissions service. It ensures compliance with relevant legislation, regulations, and regulatory requirements, aligning with UUK (Universities UK) and GuildHE (Guild of Higher Education) fair admissions principles. 3. **Subject Combinations & Retakes Policy:** This document explains that the university assesses applications individually, considering factors such as subject combinations, retakes, and the overall academic record. It clarifies that meeting the minimum entry requirements does not guarantee an offer due to competition and other factors. For MA Music Performance, APEL could be relevant if you have significant experience in the field that hasn't been formally certified.",
