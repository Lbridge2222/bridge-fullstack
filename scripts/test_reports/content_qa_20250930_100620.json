Please provide the following: * **What course is Ryan interested in?** Knowing the specific course allows me to tailor the advice to its requirements and typical applicant profile. * **What is Ryan's current application status?** (e.g., Prospect, Applied, Offer Received). This helps determine the urgency and type of information needed. * **What specific information do Ryan O'Brien want to convey to Ryan?** (e.g., application deadline, required documents, upcoming event). * **Has Ryan given GDPR consent?** If not, this limits the communication Ryan O'Brien can have. * **What is Ryan's engagement level?** (e.g., number of touchpoints, last interaction date). Low engagement may indicate a need for a more proactive approach. Once I have these details, I can provide specific and relevant guidance for Ryan O'Brien's conversation with Ryan.\n\n**Commercial Insight:** Music industry connections drive career success.

This process allows individuals without formal qualifications to gain entry to a course or receive credits towards it. **Key aspects of APEL:** * **Assessment Focus:** APEL focuses on evaluating learning outcomes achieved through experience rather than formal study. * **Evidence Required:** Individuals need to provide evidence demonstrating their skills and knowledge, such as work samples, portfolios, and references. * **Course Eligibility:** Successful APEL assessment can lead to course admission or the granting of credits, reducing the duration of study. **Next Steps:** To determine the suitability of APEL for a specific individual, it is recommended to: \n1. **Review Course Requirements:** Check the specific entry requirements and APEL guidelines for the course they are interested in.\n\n2. **Gather Evidence:** Assist the individual in compiling relevant documentation to support their APEL application. \n3. **Contact Admissions:** Reach out to the admissions department for detailed guidance on the APEL process and assessment criteria.

Inquire if he is aware whether the university permits non-standard entry or uses discretion based on experience. * **What to Tell Ryan:** Explain that universities aim to be inclusive. Ryan should verify whether his credentials align with the university's requirements and whether he can use supplementary evidence if needed. Indicate that while smaller universities may offer more flexibility, they still expect applicants to meet baseline criteria. Universities consider applications individually, including academic records. Meeting entry requirements doesn't guarantee an offer due to competition. * **Next Steps for Ryan:** Ryan should review the university's policy for his level/subject and, if using non-standard or overseas qualifications, contact admissions to check equivalency rules. He should visit the university's online admissions policy and verify requirements for his subject.
