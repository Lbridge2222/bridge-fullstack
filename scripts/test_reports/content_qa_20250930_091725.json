Encourage him to verify whether his credentials align with the university's requirements and whether supplementary evidence can be used to support his application if needed. * **Advise on Flexibility:** Suggest that smaller universities may offer more flexibility regarding admissions criteria but still expect applicants to meet baseline requirements. * **Recommend Policy Review:** Advise Ryan to review the university's admissions policy for his specific level of study and subject of interest. * **Suggest Contacting Admissions:** If Ryan intends to use non-standard or overseas qualifications, recommend that he contact the admissions department to confirm equivalency rules. * **Verify Entry Criteria:** Double-check the specific entry criteria on the university's website to ensure there are no unexpected requirements or discrepancies. * **Check Policy on Non-Standard Qualifications:** If Ryan is using non-standard qualifications or retakes, double-check the university's policy to ensure they are acceptable.
