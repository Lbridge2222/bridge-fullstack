## üîß Computed/Calculated Fields (Not in Database)

These are calculated in the application code from existing data:

### Phase 2A - Communication Velocity
**Source:** Calculated from `lead_activities` table

- `slowest_response_hours` - MAX of response times
- `response_velocity` - Categorized as very_fast/fast/moderate/slow
- **‚úÖ NO DATABASE CHANGES NEEDED**

### Phase 2A - UK HE Commitment Keywords
**Source:** Calculated from `lead_activities.activity_title` and `activity_description`
- `kw_accommodation_count` - COUNT FILTER on "accommodation", "halls"
- `kw_finance_count` - COUNT FILTER on "student finance", "tuition fee"
- `kw_term_planning_count` - COUNT FILTER on "term start", "induction", "freshers"
- `kw_academic_prep_count` - COUNT FILTER on "reading list", "course material"
- `kw_enrolment_prep_count` - COUNT FILTER on "enrolment day", "registration"
- `kw_hesitation_count` - COUNT FILTER on "other offer", "reconsider"
- **‚úÖ NO DATABASE CHANGES NEEDED** (uses existing activity data)

### Phase 2A - Existing Keywords (Already Working)
**Source:** Calculated from `lead_activities`
- `kw_deposit_count`, `kw_deadline_count`, `kw_visa_count`
- `kw_cas_count`, `kw_defer_count`, `kw_scholar_count`
- `kw_apel_rpl_count`, `kw_ucas_count`
- **‚úÖ NO DATABASE CHANGES NEEDED**

### Phase 2B - UCAS Temporal Awareness
**Source:** Calculated from current date + application `created_at`
- `ucas_period` - Calculated by `UcasCycleCalendar.get_current_period()`
- `ucas_cycle_year` - Calculated based on current month
- `days_to_equal_consideration` - Date math (current date vs 29 Jan)
- `days_to_results` - Date math (current date vs A-level results day)
- `days_to_decline_by_default` - Date math (current date vs 1 Sep)
- `ucas_temporal_adjustment` - Calculated score adjustment
- `ucas_temporal_reason` - Human-readable explanation
- `ucas_context_description` - LLM-friendly context
- **‚úÖ NO DATABASE CHANGES NEEDED** (pure date calculations)

### Phase 2C - Interview Ratings (Calculated Aggregates)
**Source:** Calculated from `interviews` table with ratings
- `interview_count` - COUNT(*)
- `rated_interview_count` - COUNT WHERE overall_rating IS NOT NULL
- `avg_overall_rating` - AVG(overall_rating)
- `max_overall_rating` - MAX(overall_rating)
- `min_overall_rating` - MIN(overall_rating)
- `avg_technical_rating` - AVG(technical_rating)
- `avg_portfolio_rating` - AVG(portfolio_rating)
- `avg_communication_rating` - AVG(communication_rating)
- `avg_motivation_rating` - AVG(motivation_rating)
- `avg_fit_rating` - AVG(fit_rating)
- `latest_overall_rating` - Latest rating via subquery
- `latest_portfolio_rating` - Latest portfolio rating via subquery
- **‚úÖ DATABASE COLUMNS ADDED** (migration 0033 applied)

### Other Calculated Fields
- `days_in_pipeline` - NOW() - application.created_at
- `days_since_last_update` - NOW() - application.updated_at
- `days_since_engagement` - Calculated from activities
- `engagement_level` - Categorized from engagement_score
- `lead_quality` - Categorized from lead_score
- `source_quality` - Categorized from source
- `urgency_score` - Calculated composite score
- `is_responsive` - Boolean based on days_since_engagement
- `has_contact_info` - Boolean based on email/phone presence
- `email_engagement_rate` - Calculated from email activities
- `portal_engagement_level` - Categorized from portal_login_count
- `document_activity_level` - Categorized from document_activity_count
- **‚úÖ NO DATABASE CHANGES NEEDED** (all calculated from existing data)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues

### Issue 1: `lead_activities` Query Placeholder Error
**Error seen in logs:**
```
only '%s', '%b', '%t' are allowed as placeholders, got '%d'
```

**Location:** Lines 367-447 in `application_ml.py` - the keyword extraction query

**Problem:** The query uses `INTERVAL '90 days'` which the error handler interprets as a placeholder issue

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NON-CRITICAL** - Error is caught by try/except, falls back to 0 for all keyword counts

**Fix needed:** Replace `INTERVAL '90 days'` with parameter:
```python
WHERE lead_id = %s
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'

# Should be:
WHERE lead_id = %s
  AND created_at > %s

# With parameter:
str(row['person_id']), (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=90))
```

## Summary

### ‚úÖ All Clear
- **Phase 2A (Communication Velocity):** All calculated, no DB changes needed
- **Phase 2A (Commitment Keywords):** All calculated from existing activity data
- **Phase 2B (UCAS Temporal):** All date calculations, no DB changes needed
- **Phase 2C (Interview Ratings):** Columns added via migration 0033 ‚úÖ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Fix Needed
- **Keyword extraction query:** Has a placeholder warning (non-critical, falls back to 0)

### üéØ Recommendation

**Option 1: Fix the keyword query** (5 minutes)
Replace the interval syntax to avoid the placeholder warning

**Option 2: Leave as-is**
The system works fine with the fallback (all keyword counts = 0 when query fails). Not critical since keywords are just one of many signals.

**Option 3: Test with a fix**
I can fix the query now if you want to ensure keyword tracking is working properly.

## Database Schema Verification Checklist

Run this in Supabase to verify all required columns exist:

```sql
-- Check interviews table has rating columns
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'interviews'
  AND column_name IN (
    'overall_rating', 'technical_rating', 'portfolio_rating',
    'communication_rating', 'motivation_rating', 'fit_rating',
    'rating_notes', 'rated_by_user_id', 'rated_at'
  )
ORDER BY column_name;

-- Should return 9 rows if migration was successful
```

**Expected result:** 9 rows showing all rating columns exist.

If you see all 9 columns, then **everything is good to go**! üéâ
