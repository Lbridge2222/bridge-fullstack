# Ivy OS – Pitch Deck Copy

## Slide 1: Title / Hook

**Logo:** Ivy OS

**Headline:** The Intelligence Layer for Higher Education

**Sub-headline:** AI-native CRM + SIS delivering ±5% forecast accuracy, automated triage, and real-time institutional intelligence, replacing the £40k/year fragmented systems universities currently struggle with.

**Badge:** PRE-SEED | RAISING £450k

**Terms:** £5m cap • 20% discount SAFE

**Footer note:** Built by the Head of Student Recruitment with 5+ years managing live HE pipelines.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**Headline:** Universities spend ≈ £40k a year on systems that still force them to guess.

**Sub-headline:** The tools driving modern business growth don't speak Higher Education — and the ones built for HE can't keep up with modern performance needs.

**Problem Table:**

| System | Typical Cost | The Reality |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Sales CRMs (HubSpot / Salesforce) | £20–30k | Built for MQL → SQL → Customer. Doesn't map to enquiry → applicant → offer → enrolled — forecasting breaks. |
| Legacy SIS (Ellucian / Unit4 / Tribal) | £50–150k | Compliance-first, slow to change, no predictive capability. |
| Spreadsheets + manual workarounds | £30–50k staff time | Brittle, siloed, and reactive — leadership can't see the full picture. |

**Founder insight:**

"I ran admissions and recruitment for five years and lived this daily. The problem isn't capability—it's context. Sales CRMs don't speak Higher Education, and legacy SIS tools can't drive decisions. Ivy OS exists because the sector needs both in one system."

---

## Slide 3: The Opportunity

**Headline:** A £150M replacement market hiding in plain sight

**Subtext:** Every university already pays for CRMs, SIS tools, and spreadsheets — Ivy OS replaces them with one intelligent platform built for Higher Education.

**The market reality**
| Segment | Institutions | Typical Current Spend | Addressable Value |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| UK Higher Education | 400+ (OfS register) | £30–50k each | ≈ £16M SAM |
| English-language HE (IE, AU, NZ, CA) | 500+ | £30–40k each | +£130M |
| **Total near-term opportunity** | — | — | **≈ £150M** |

**The problem behind the spend**
Every institution already has:
- A CRM built for business pipelines
- A student information system designed for compliance
- Teams bridging the gap manually

They're not under-investing — they're investing in the wrong tools.

**The inevitability**
Within five years, AI-native operational intelligence will be standard across UK universities.

The question isn't if institutions adopt it — it's who builds the platform that becomes infrastructure.

🧱 **Procurement-friendly entry: 3–6 month pilot under departmental thresholds**

**Highlight:**

Ivy OS isn't creating a new budget line. It's replacing fragmented £40k stacks with a unified, AI-native system that actually understands Higher Education.

---

## Slide 4: The Solution

**Headline:** One system. One truth. Built around the real student journey.

**Sub-headline:** Ivy OS unifies CRM, student records, and institutional intelligence around the Higher Education lifecycle — enquiry → application → offer → enrolment → progression → alumni.

**What Ivy OS is**

The first AI-native operating system for Higher Education, combining the data depth of an SIS with the usability of a modern CRM. It connects every stage of the pipeline and learns continuously from each institution's activity to improve prediction, triage, and decision-making over time.

**How it works**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│  USER LAYER: HE workflows          │
│  Enquiry → Application → Offer →   │
│  Enrolment → Progression → Alumni  │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
                 ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│  INTELLIGENCE LAYER: AI copilots   │
│  • Predictive triage & risk scoring│
│  • Policy-aware Q&A (UCAS, OfS)    │
│  • Smart communications composer   │
│  • Live forecast refinement        │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
                 ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│  DATA LAYER: Unified CRM + SIS     │

│  student data — single source of   │
│  truth                             │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it's different**

Most platforms bolt AI on top of legacy systems.
Ivy OS is AI-first by design, so intelligence is built into every workflow, not added later.
- Data model built for HE from day one
- Forecasts and triage scores improve automatically with each cycle
- AI copilots act in context — no switching tools or exporting data
- One login, one interface, one accurate picture

**Bottom line:**

Ivy OS doesn't make universities better at using generic tools — it gives them tools actually built for what they do.

---

## Slide 7: Competitive Landscape

**Headline:** Why incumbents can't move fast enough — and new entrants can't go deep enough.

**Sub-headline:** Ivy OS is 18 months ahead, combining deep domain insight with a modern AI-native foundation that legacy vendors can't rebuild and startups can't replicate.

**Market Positioning:**

| Player | Built For | Core Limitation | Ivy OS Edge |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| HubSpot / Salesforce | B2B sales funnels (MQL → SQL → Customer) | Wrong data model for HE; pipelines, not admissions lifecycles | Native HE data model (enquiry → offer → enrolment → alumni) |
| Ellucian / Unit4 / Tribal | Compliance and record-keeping | Legacy monoliths with bolt-on AI; slow innovation; poor UX | Modern, modular, AI-first with consumer-grade interface |
| Point Solutions / Chatbots | Isolated features (lead scoring, chat) | No end-to-end workflow or data layer; low institutional trust | Unified OS connecting CRM, SIS, and forecasting |
| University IT / Internal Builds | Bespoke internal tools | Limited resources, high maintenance, no ML expertise | Product-level R&D shared across institutions |

**Why Incumbents Can't Compete:**

**HubSpot & Salesforce**
- Make billions on B2B sales — no incentive to rebuild core architecture for a £20M HE vertical
- Their data models, pipelines, and dashboards simply don't fit enquiry-to-enrolment lifecycles
- AI features are retrofitted assistants, not native intelligence

**Ellucian / Unit4 / Tribal**
- 20-year-old tech stacks and legacy database schemas
- Costly customisation, poor UX, slow release cycles
- Their AI "layers" are marketing, not operational intelligence

**New EdTech Startups**
- Mostly focused on student engagement or marketing, not admissions infrastructure
- Lack domain depth and HE procurement experience
- Building horizontally — Ivy's advantage compounds through specialised data

**Why Our Lead Compounds Over Time:**

| Year | Ivy OS Position | Competitor Position |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| Now (0 months) | Working MVP, AI substrate live, proven ±5% forecast accuracy | No AI-native HE platform in production |
| +12 months | 3 institutional pilots → 6,000+ applications in dataset | Early prototypes, no institutional data |
| +24 months | 10 institutions → 20,000+ applications feeding model refinement | 1-2 pilots, no UCAS/OfS integrations |
| +36 months | 25+ institutions → 50,000+ applications, integration ecosystem established | Too late: switching costs + data moat locked in |

**The Moat:**
Better data → better models → better outcomes → more customers → even better data.
This flywheel compounds quarterly, not annually.

**Highlight:**

This isn't a "best features" race — it's a best dataset race.
Ivy OS's 18-month head start and deep HE data foundation make its competitive advantage self-reinforcing.

---

## Slide 8: Traction / Proof Point

**Headline:** Proven in production: ±5% forecast accuracy in real Higher Education admissions

**Sub-headline:** Ivy OS evolved from five years of live operational systems, not a prototype.

**Founder Context:**

"Over several years leading student recruitment and admissions at WaterBear College of Music, I rebuilt our data infrastructure from the ground up — exporting from HubSpot into Supabase, modelling conversion rates with XGBoost and Prophet, and designing SQL pipelines to track performance in real time. What began as an internal rebuild became the foundation for Ivy OS."

— Laurance Bridge, Founder

**What's Proven:**

| Area | Before | After Ivy OS Foundations | Impact |
|------|--------|--------------------------|--------|
| Forecast accuracy | ±15–20% error | ±5% of final enrolments | Confident, early budget planning |
| Manual triage time | 12 hrs/week | 4–5 hrs/week | 60% time saving for admissions staff |
| Reporting | Ad-hoc, Excel-based | Live dashboards | Instant visibility across the pipeline |
| Decision confidence | Reactive and uncertain | Data-backed, real-time | Leadership planning months earlier |

**What This Demonstrates:**
- Forecasting and triage models already work in live HE environments
- Measurable ROI delivered in time saved and forecast accuracy
- The workflows mirror real institutional operations — not theory
- Institutions are voicing the same unmet need across the sector

**Early Interest:**

Warm institutions in active discussion:
- **WaterBear College of Music** — source institution and live dataset foundation for the original system that became Ivy OS
- **BIMM Group** — strong founder relationship with the Group CMO (who previously offered the founder a senior role) and demonstrated interest in AI tools to improve multi-campus recruitment and forecasting
- **Falmouth University** — constructive conversation with the Head of Digital Marketing highlighting shared pain points: data split across HubSpot, SIS, and analytics systems; API integrations requiring IT board approval for compliance; and the need for a unified platform

Each conversation follows the same pattern:

"We're trying to make HubSpot work for admissions — it just doesn't fit."

**Highlight:**

Ivy OS is not a concept — it's the commercialisation of a proven system that has already delivered measurable results inside Higher Education admissions.

---

## Slide 9: Business Model & Pricing

**Headline:** Predictable, budget-neutral pricing designed for Higher Education

**Sub-headline:** Ivy OS replaces multiple fragmented systems with one AI-native platform — delivering institutional-grade capability for the same annual spend most universities already make on HubSpot, spreadsheets, and timetabling tools.

**Pricing Tiers:**

| Tier | Typical Institution | Active Students (FTE) | Annual Fee (£) | Includes |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Starter** | Specialist colleges / private providers | ≤ 500 | 18,000/yr | Full CRM + SIS-lite + AI Comms + core reporting |
| **Growth** | Mid-size universities / FE HE arms | 501 – 3,000 | 32,000/yr | Adds Compliance Analytics + Multi-Campus support |
| **Enterprise** | Post-92 / Large HEIs | 3,001 – 10,000+ | 55,000/yr | Full OS suite + Advanced Automation + Priority SLA + Integrations |
| **Group / System** | University groups / franchises | — | from 80,000/yr | Multi-tenant data lake + Custom SSO + API priority |

🕒 **Pilot (≤ 6 months) • Half-fee • Converts on success**

**Pricing Philosophy:**
- ✅ **Budget-neutral** — replaces 3–4 existing tools
- ✅ **Procurement-friendly** — flat annual fee
- ✅ **Scalable** — simple growth by FTE
- ✅ **Low risk** — pilot option (3–6 months at 50% annual fee)

**Founder quote:**

"Universities already spend £30–50k on HubSpot, timetabling, and spreadsheets just to keep admissions running. Ivy OS delivers all of that — plus AI-powered forecasting and automation — for the same spend, built for education from day one."

**Bottom line:**

One clear institutional subscription. One operating system for Higher Education. Built to slot into existing budgets, not add to them.

Future expansion will come through deeper integrations — connecting timetabling, communications, and analytics natively within Ivy OS as institutions scale.

**Year 2 – Early Growth**
- Convert pilots to annual contracts
- Add 7–12 new customers through referrals and case studies
- Begin expansion into additional HE networks
- Target: **£350–500k ARR**

**Year 3 – Scale Momentum**
- 25–40 total customers, mostly Growth/Enterprise tier
- Pricing power increases with proof points and integrations
- Target: **£1–1.5M ARR**

**Unit Economics (Mature State):**

| Metric | Value | Benchmark / Notes |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Blended ACV | £42,000 | Weighted toward Growth/Enterprise tiers |
| Gross Margin | 92% | Typical 70–85% SaaS → infrastructure ≈ 8% of rev |
| CAC | £15,000 | Founder-led → content → inside-sales evolution |
| Payback Period | 13 months | Within B2B SaaS norm (12–18 mo) |
| LTV | £150,000+ | 4+ year retention; HE switching cost high |
| LTV:CAC | 10:1 | Exceptional efficiency for early-stage SaaS |

**Market Capture:**

At £40k average contract:
- UK market = 400 institutions × £40k = £16M SAM
- 5% market share = £800k ARR
- With retention and modest expansion → £1M+ run-rate

**Bottom line:**

A capital-efficient, 24-month path from £75k to £1M+ ARR, built on high-margin SaaS economics, realistic conversion assumptions, and an addressable UK market hiding in plain sight.

## Slide 11: Why Now / The AI Edge

**Headline:** The sector is under pressure, the technology is ready, and the incumbents can't move fast enough.

**Sub-headline:** Ivy OS arrives at the exact moment when Higher Education needs to modernise operations — and AI finally makes it possible.

**1. Sector Pressure Is Reaching Breaking Point**
- OfS and compliance expectations are rising: universities must now evidence recruitment ROI, retention, and progression through verifiable data, not assumptions
- **Franchise and partner colleges above ~300 students will soon be required to apply for OfS registration themselves** — adding new regulatory and reporting burdens to smaller institutions without dedicated data infrastructure
- Budgets are tightening: recruitment and admissions teams are expected to deliver more with less, while juggling fragmented systems and manual reporting
- Leadership urgency: Vice-Chancellors, Marketing, and Registry teams all need real-time visibility and audit-ready data for OfS and internal boards

*In short: operational compliance and performance accountability are converging — creating a perfect storm Ivy OS is built to solve.*

**2. Technology Has Finally Caught Up**
- LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude) are now reliable enough for production use with stable APIs and predictable cost structures
- RAG architecture enables policy-aware copilots that can reference UCAS and OfS guidance accurately
- Modern infrastructure stack (Supabase, pgvector, LangChain, FastAPI) makes AI-native SaaS platforms fast, secure, and affordable
- 10× cost reduction in inference pricing over two years means scalable AI is now economically viable for education providers

*Result: the technical barriers that once made AI impractical in HE are gone.*

**3. Incumbents Are Structurally Stuck**

| Incumbent Type | Constraint | Why It Matters |
|----------------|------------|----------------|
| Sales CRMs (HubSpot / Salesforce) | Wrong data model (MQL → SQL) | Would need full rebuild for HE — they won't |
| Legacy SIS (Ellucian / Unit4) | 20-year-old architecture | Can't retrofit modern AI or UI; too much tech debt |
| Horizontal AI Tools | No domain context | Impressive demos, zero operational value in HE workflows |
| University IT Teams | Limited capacity & AI expertise | Reinventing the wheel case-by-case; not sustainable |

*Net effect: Ivy OS moves faster, cleaner, and with deeper domain fit — while incumbents are years away from parity.*

**Timing Advantage:**
- **18-month head start:** working AI triage, forecasting, and CRM features already in production
- **Warm pipeline:** active discussions with WaterBear, BIMM, and Falmouth
- **Market gap:** no credible AI-native HE operating system exists yet
- **Window:** measured in quarters, not years — before incumbents adapt and procurement cycles renew

**Bottom line:**

Regulatory pressure, technical readiness, and incumbent inertia have aligned. Ivy OS is positioned to define the category of AI-native Higher Education operations software — and the window is open now.

⚡ **Framework-ready product: cuts typical HE procurement from 9 months → 6 weeks**
