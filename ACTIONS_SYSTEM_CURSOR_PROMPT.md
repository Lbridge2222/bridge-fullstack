# Cursor Prompt: Actions System Complete - Reference & Next Steps

## Context: What Was Built

This prompt documents the **Actions System** that was built for the admissions board. It's a class-leading intelligent action triage system that helps admissions staff prioritize and execute their next best action on every applicant.

**Current Status:** Phase A complete. All core functionality working. Ready for Phase B integration work.

**Documentation:** See `ACTIONS_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md` for full implementation details.

## What's Working Now

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

**Triage Engine** - `backend/app/ai/triage_engine.py` (600+ lines)
- Multi-factor priority formula: `(0.4 Ã— impact) + (0.35 Ã— urgency) + (0.25 Ã— freshness)`
- 9 urgency contexts with multipliers (5.0x for expiring offers â†’ 1.0x default)
- Exponential engagement decay: `1 - e^(-days/14)`
- Stage-specific artifact generation (email templates, call scripts, talking points)

**Actions API** - `backend/app/routers/actions.py` (500+ lines)
- `POST /api/actions/triage` - Generate prioritized queue (limit=5 default)
- `POST /api/actions/simulate` - Preview artifacts before executing
- `POST /api/actions/execute` - Execute action, log to database
- `GET/PATCH /api/actions/session` - Session context persistence

**Database** - `backend/db/migrations/0035_actions_system.sql`
- 4 tables: `user_session_memory`, `action_queue`, `action_executions`, `ai_events`
- All tables have RLS (row level security)
- Indexes on priority, user, application, event_type
- Telemetry captured for all operations

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

**Actions Dropdown Menu** - `frontend/src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.tsx`
- Clean shadcn DropdownMenu in header
- 6 menu items:
  - âž• New Application
  - ðŸŽ¯ Top Daily Actions (full queue)
  - âš¡ Next Best Action (limit=1)
  - ðŸš© View Blockers (TODO)
  - ðŸ“Š Daily Report (TODO)
  - ðŸŽ¯ Focus Mode (TODO)

**Triage Modal** - `frontend/src/components/Actions/TriageModal.tsx` (350 lines)
- Ranked list of actions with priority badges
- Color-coded action types (email=blue, call=green, flag=amber, unblock=purple)
- Expandable artifacts (emails, scripts, talking points)
- One-click execution with loading states

**Session Store** - `frontend/src/stores/sessionStore.ts`
- Zustand-powered persistent state
- Tracks: activeStage, viewedApplications, lastTriageIds, preferences
- Hydrates from localStorage + syncs with backend

**Keyboard Shortcuts**
- `âŒ˜A` / `Ctrl+A` â†’ Top Daily Actions
- `âŒ˜N` / `Ctrl+N` â†’ New Application
- `âŒ˜K` / `Ctrl+K` â†’ Ask Ivy (foundation ready)

---

## Deferred to Phase B

These were explicitly deferred per user approval:
- Daily Report endpoint (`/api/brief/today`)
- View Blockers filter
- Focus Mode routing
- Ask Ivy two-way integration (badges, action events)
- SMS integration
- Booking slots
- "Send All" bulk actions

## If Continuing with Another LLM

### Key Files to Reference

**Backend Architecture:**
- `backend/app/ai/triage_engine.py` - Core priority calculation and artifact generation
- `backend/app/routers/actions.py` - HTTP API endpoints
- `backend/db/migrations/0035_actions_system.sql` - Database schema

**Frontend Architecture:**
- `frontend/src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.tsx` - Actions dropdown menu location and keyboard shortcuts
- `frontend/src/components/Actions/TriageModal.tsx` - Main modal UI
- `frontend/src/services/actionsApi.ts` - API client
- `frontend/src/stores/sessionStore.ts` - Session state management
- `frontend/src/types/actions.ts` - TypeScript interfaces

### Running the System

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Test:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
2. Press âŒ˜A or click Actions menu
3. Click "Top Daily Actions" to see prioritized queue
4. Click "Next Best Action" to see single item

---

## Known Issues & Gotchas

1. **User ID Handling**
   - Currently uses first user from database
   - TODO: Replace with proper auth (Supabase auth.uid())
   - Function: `get_current_user_id()` in `actions.py`

2. **Triage Filtering**
   - Excludes: enrolled, rejected, offer_withdrawn, offer_declined
   - Includes all other stages (no status filter)

3. **Telemetry**
   - `user_id` stored in `payload_json` instead of FK to avoid constraint issues
   - Can be queried from: `payload_json->>'user_id'`

4. **Session Memory**
   - Persisted to localStorage (frontend) and `user_session_memory` table (backend)
   - Currently no webhook sync (frontend is source of truth)

---

## Priority Calculation Formula (For Reference)

```python
priority = (0.4 Ã— impact) + (0.35 Ã— urgency) + (0.25 Ã— freshness)
priority = priority Ã— (0.5 + conversion_probability)

where:
  impact = estimate of how much this action will increase conversion
  urgency = normalized multiplier based on 9 contexts:
    - offer_expires_today: 5.0x
    - clearing_period: 3.0x
    - interview_tomorrow: 2.5x
    - unresponsive_14d: 2.5x
    - (etc - see triage_engine.py line 28-38)
  freshness = 1 - exponential_decay
    = 1 - (1 - e^(-days_since_engagement / 14))
```

## Next Phase Work (Phase B)

### 1. Daily Report
- Backend: `GET /api/brief/today` endpoint
- Returns: Summary of day's actions, KPIs, top performers
- Frontend: Dialog component to display report

### 2. View Blockers
- Backend: Already surfaced in ML features
- Frontend: Toggle filter on applications board
- Show only applications with `progression_blockers` not empty

### 3. Ask Ivy Integration
- Frontend: Emit `ivy:suggestAction` event when Ivy suggests actions
- Show ðŸ”¥ badge on Actions dropdown when suggestions exist
- Emit `action:completed` when action executed
- Show activity chips on board: "Email sent 2m ago"

### 4. Focus Mode
- Route to focus layout (`/focus` or route state)
- Hide distractions, maximize triage
- Quick navigation between top actions

## Questions to Ask Before Continuing

1. **Authentication:** Should user_id come from Supabase auth.uid() or keep current implementation?
2. **Daily Report:** What KPIs should be included in the brief?
3. **Ask Ivy Integration:** Should suggestions auto-populate Actions queue or just show badge?
4. **Performance:** Any concerns about triage generation time (~150ms for 50 apps)?
5. **Next Phases:** Priority for Phase B work - Report, Blockers, or Ask Ivy integration first?
