## ü§ñ AI Implementation - GOSPEL TRUTH

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: The AI integration in this project is enshrined as GOSPEL TRUTH.**

The AI system has been tested, proven, and documented. Any deviation from the documented implementation will break the system.

### **Preservation Rules:**
1. **NEVER** bypass LangChain - it's the substrate orchestration layer
2. **NEVER** create custom wrappers - use native integrations only
3. **NEVER** change dependency versions without testing
4. **ALWAYS** preserve fallback mechanisms
5. **ALWAYS** test thoroughly before deployment

### **Reference Documents:**
- **`AI_IMPLEMENTATION_GOSPEL.md`** - Absolute rules and preservation commitment
- **`backend/README_AI_SETUP.md`** - Complete technical implementation guide

**This is the gospel. Follow it exactly. Preserve it at all costs.**
