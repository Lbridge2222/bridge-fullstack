## 🤖 AI Implementation - GOSPEL TRUTH

### Dual-mode Ivy Responses (Backend)

- Conversational (default)
  - Endpoint: `POST /ai/router/v2` or `POST /rag/query_v2`
  - Returns envelope:
    - kind: "conversational"
    - answer_markdown: short paragraphs, British English
    - actions: array of `{label, action}` where action ∈ {open_call_console, open_email_composer, open_meeting_scheduler, view_profile}
    - maybe_modal: optional `{type, payload}` suggestion (safe to ignore)
    - sources: optional compact previews (≤3)
  - Feature flag: `IVY_ORGANIC_ENABLED=true` enables organic prompt and paragraph style.

- Modal (structured)
  - Endpoint: `POST /ai/router/v2` with modal intent or explicit FE flow
  - Returns envelope:
    - kind: "modal"
    - modal: `{type, payload}` exactly as FE expects today
    - actions: optional UI actions (canonical names)

Example (conversational):

```
{
  "kind": "conversational",
  "answer_markdown": "Isla is interested in Music Performance...",
  "actions": [{"label": "Open Call Console", "action": "open_call_console"}],
  "maybe_modal": {"type": "suggestions", "payload": {"leadId": "..."}},
  "sources": [{"title": "Entry Requirements", "preview": "..."}]
}
```

Example (modal):

```
{
  "kind": "modal",
  "modal": {"type": "suggestions", "payload": {"modal_title": "AI Suggestions — Isla", "summary_bullets": ["…"]}},
  "actions": [{"label": "Book 1-1", "action": "open_meeting_scheduler"}]
}
```


**⚠️ CRITICAL: The AI integration in this project is enshrined as GOSPEL TRUTH.**

The AI system has been tested, proven, and documented. Any deviation from the documented implementation will break the system.

### **Preservation Rules:**
1. **NEVER** bypass LangChain - it's the substrate orchestration layer
2. **NEVER** create custom wrappers - use native integrations only
3. **NEVER** change dependency versions without testing
4. **ALWAYS** preserve fallback mechanisms
5. **ALWAYS** test thoroughly before deployment

### **Reference Documents:**
- **[AI Documentation](AI_DOCUMENTATION.md)** - Complete AI implementation guide
- **[Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)** - Development and troubleshooting
- **[API Reference](API_REFERENCE.md)** - AI endpoint documentation

**This is the gospel. Follow it exactly. Preserve it at all costs.**
