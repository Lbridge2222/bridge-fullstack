# Ivy ‚Äì The Higher Education OS ‚Äì Full Stack

This project contains both frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind) and backend (Python + ML/forecasting) code for the Ivy prototype.

## üìå Project Scope

Ivy is an independently developed prototype designed to modernise higher-education operations. It integrates admissions RevOps best practices with real-time analytics and machine learning forecasting models.

## ü§ñ AI Implementation - GOSPEL TRUTH

### Dual-mode Ivy Responses (Backend)

- Conversational (default)
  - Endpoint: `POST /ai/router/v2` or `POST /rag/query_v2`
  - Returns envelope:
    - kind: "conversational"
    - answer_markdown: short paragraphs, British English
    - actions: array of `{label, action}` where action ‚àà {open_call_console, open_email_composer, open_meeting_scheduler, view_profile}
    - maybe_modal: optional `{type, payload}` suggestion (safe to ignore)
    - sources: optional compact previews (‚â§3)
  - Feature flag: `IVY_ORGANIC_ENABLED=true` enables organic prompt and paragraph style.

- Modal (structured)
  - Endpoint: `POST /ai/router/v2` with modal intent or explicit FE flow
  - Returns envelope:
    - kind: "modal"
    - modal: `{type, payload}` exactly as FE expects today
    - actions: optional UI actions (canonical names)

Example (conversational):

```
{
  "kind": "conversational",
  "answer_markdown": "Isla is interested in Music Performance...",
  "actions": [{"label": "Open Call Console", "action": "open_call_console"}],
  "maybe_modal": {"type": "suggestions", "payload": {"leadId": "..."}},
  "sources": [{"title": "Entry Requirements", "preview": "..."}]
}
```

Example (modal):

```
{
  "kind": "modal",
  "modal": {"type": "suggestions", "payload": {"modal_title": "AI Suggestions ‚Äî Isla", "summary_bullets": ["‚Ä¶"]}},
  "actions": [{"label": "Book 1-1", "action": "open_meeting_scheduler"}]
}
```


**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: The AI integration in this project is enshrined as GOSPEL TRUTH.**

The AI system has been tested, proven, and documented. Any deviation from the documented implementation will break the system.

### **Preservation Rules:**
1. **NEVER** bypass LangChain - it's the substrate orchestration layer
2. **NEVER** create custom wrappers - use native integrations only
3. **NEVER** change dependency versions without testing
4. **ALWAYS** preserve fallback mechanisms
5. **ALWAYS** test thoroughly before deployment

### **Reference Documents:**
- **`AI_IMPLEMENTATION_GOSPEL.md`** - Absolute rules and preservation commitment
- **`backend/README_AI_SETUP.md`** - Complete technical implementation guide

**This is the gospel. Follow it exactly. Preserve it at all costs.**

## ü§ñ ML Prediction System - PRODUCTION READY

**Status**: ‚úÖ **100% VERIFIED & PRODUCTION READY**

The ML prediction system for lead conversion probability is fully functional and integrated.

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend  
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Open: http://localhost:5173/crm/leads
```

### **ML System Features**
- **Lead Conversion Predictions**: 34% average probability
- **Model Confidence**: 66-68% confidence scores
- **Feature Engineering**: 40% feature coverage
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic prediction loading
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error management
- **Performance**: ~160ms response time

### **ML Documentation**
- **`ML_QUICK_START.md`** - 5-minute setup guide
- **`FRONTEND_ML_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Complete integration guide
- **`backend/ML_IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`** - Implementation details
- **`backend/README_ML_DEV.md`** - Developer documentation
- **`backend/app/ai/REPORT_ML_AUDIT.md`** - Technical audit report

### **Verification Results**
| Test Category | Status | Details |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Backend Health | ‚úÖ PASS | Model loaded, 20 features |
