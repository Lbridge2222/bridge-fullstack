# Phase 3: Intervention Plan Generation - Debugging Session

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Issue:** Follow-up detection not triggering intervention plan generation
**Status:** üîß In Progress

---

## Problem Statement

When users ask "How's the pipeline today?", Ivy responds with:
> "Would you like me to create personalised intervention plans for these applicants?"

When users respond "yes", Ivy should generate intervention plans. Instead, it's treating "yes" as a new query and repeating the pipeline summary.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Backend Candidates Empty for General Queries ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** When asking "How's the pipeline today?", the response includes intervention plan text, but the `candidates` array is empty (0 candidates). This means `backend_candidates` stored in conversation history is also empty.

**Why This Happens:** General pipeline queries don't trigger action candidate extraction. The LLM generates a response mentioning specific applicants (Harper Martin, Marco Rossi, etc.), but these aren't captured as `candidates`.

**Original Fix Attempt (FLAWED):**
```python
# Lines 1289-1312 (OLD VERSION)
# Excluded terminal stages like 'rejected', 'offer_withdrawn', 'offer_declined'
# This was wrong because LLM mentions these applicants anyway!
```

**Current Fix (IMPROVED):**
```python
# Lines 1289-1312 (NEW VERSION)
# Extract applicant IDs based on names actually mentioned in LLM response
# If response mentions "Harper Martin", find that applicant in topAtRisk and get ID
```

**How It Works:**
1. Check if response asks about intervention plans but candidates is empty
2. Extract names mentioned in the response (e.g., "Harper Martin", "Marco Rossi")
3. Map those names to application_ids from `summary.topAtRisk`
4. Store these IDs as `backend_candidates` in conversation history

---

### Issue 2: Follow-Up Detection Working but Plans Not Generated üîç INVESTIGATING

**Hypothesis:** Follow-up detection (`detect_followup_intent`) successfully detects "yes" as affirmative, and returns `referenced_applicants` from `last_assistant_msg.backend_candidates`. But the conditional logic at line 1203 isn't matching, or `applicant_ids` is empty.

**Debugging Approach:**

Added comprehensive logging to trace the flow:

1. **Line 1129**: Log referenced applicant IDs when follow-up detected
2. **Line 1131**: Log when NOT a follow-up
3. **Line 1199-1201**: Log last assistant message preview, intervention text detection, and backend candidates
4. **Line 1205**: Confirm when reaching intervention plan generation block
5. **Line 1208**: Log applicant IDs extracted from followup_context
6. **Line 1211**: Confirm plan generation starts
7. **Line 1216**: Warning if no applicant IDs found

**Expected Log Output (Working Case):**
```
INFO: Detected follow-up: affirmative, referenced 5 applicants
DEBUG: Referenced applicant IDs: ['550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440405', ...]
DEBUG: Last assistant message preview: The current application pipeline shows...
DEBUG: Contains intervention plans text: True
DEBUG: Backend candidates from last message: ['550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440405', ...]
INFO: ‚úÖ User requested intervention plan generation (Step 1)
DEBUG: Applicant IDs from followup_context: ['550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440405', ...]
INFO: ‚úÖ Generating intervention plans for 5 applicants
```

**Expected Log Output (Failing Case - Hypothesis 1: Backend candidates empty):**
```
INFO: Detected follow-up: affirmative, referenced 0 applicants
DEBUG: Referenced applicant IDs: []
DEBUG: Backend candidates from last message: []
DEBUG: Applicant IDs from followup_context: []
WARNING: ‚ùå No applicant IDs found - cannot generate intervention plans
```

**Expected Log Output (Failing Case - Hypothesis 2: Follow-up not detected):**
```
DEBUG: Not a follow-up query
[Proceeds to normal pipeline query logic]
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/app/routers/applications_insights.py`

**Lines 1289-1312: Improved Applicant ID Extraction**
- Extract names mentioned in LLM response
- Map names to application_ids from `summary.topAtRisk`
- Store as `backend_candidates` in conversation history

**Lines 1124-1131: Enhanced Follow-Up Detection Logging**
- Log referenced applicant IDs when follow-up detected
- Log when NOT a follow-up

**Lines 1198-1216: Intervention Plan Generation Logging**
- Log last assistant message details
- Log when reaching intervention plan generation
- Log applicant IDs from followup_context
- Warning if no IDs found

---

## Testing Tools Created

### `test_intervention_flow.sh`

Bash script to test the full flow:

**Step 1:** Send "How is the pipeline today?" and capture session_id
**Step 2:** Send "yes" with session_id and check response

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start backend server first
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# In another terminal
./test_intervention_flow.sh
```

**Output:**
- Session ID from step 1
- Whether response contains intervention plans text
- Answer preview from step 2
- Whether step 2 contains action emojis (üìû, ‚úâÔ∏è, üì±)
- Saves full responses to `/tmp/test_step1.json` and `/tmp/test_step2.json`

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run Backend Server** with logging visible
2. **Execute `test_intervention_flow.sh`** to trigger the flow
3. **Check Backend Logs** for DEBUG output showing:
   - Is follow-up detected? ("Detected follow-up: affirmative")
   - What are referenced_applicants? (Should be 5 UUIDs)
   - Does it reach "‚úÖ User requested intervention plan generation"?
   - Does it reach "‚úÖ Generating intervention plans for X applicants"?
   - Or does it show "‚ùå No applicant IDs found"?

4. **Based on Logs, Fix the Issue:**

   **If backend_candidates is empty:**
   - Issue is in name extraction logic (lines 1289-1312)
   - LLM might be formatting names differently than expected
   - Add logging to show `mentioned_names` list

   **If follow-up not detected:**
   - Issue is in `detect_followup_intent` function
   - Conversation history might not be loaded
   - Session might not be persisting correctly

   **If it reaches line 1203 but doesn't match:**
   - Issue is with the text matching logic
   - Might need to check exact wording in last_assistant_msg.content

## Code Flow Summary

```
User: "How's the pipeline today?"
  ‚Üì
[Normal Query Flow]
  ‚Üì
LLM generates answer mentioning applicants
  ‚Üì
Extract mentioned names from answer (lines 1289-1312)
  ‚Üì
Map names ‚Üí application_ids
  ‚Üì
Store as backend_candidates in conversation history (line 1322)
  ‚Üì
Return response with session_id

---

User: "yes" (with session_id)
  ‚Üì
Load conversation history (line 1121)
  ‚Üì
Detect follow-up intent (line 1125)
  ‚Üí Should detect: is_followup=True, followup_type="affirmative"
  ‚Üí Should extract: referenced_applicants from last_assistant_msg.backend_candidates
  ‚Üì
Check if affirmative follow-up (line 1134)
  ‚Üì
Check if about "create these actions in your system" (line 1138)
  ‚Üí No match, continue
  ‚Üì
Check if about "create personalised intervention plans" (line 1203)
  ‚Üí Should match!
  ‚Üì
Get applicant_ids from followup_context (line 1207)
  ‚Üì
If applicant_ids exist (line 1210):
  ‚Üí Generate intervention plans (line 1213)
  ‚Üí Format as markdown (line 1214)
  ‚Üí Return formatted plans
Else:
  ‚Üí Warning: No applicant IDs found (line 1216)
  ‚Üí Falls through to normal query logic
```

## Known Issues

### 1. Name Extraction Might Miss Variants

**Problem:** If LLM formats names differently (e.g., "Harper M." vs "Harper Martin"), the exact match `name in answer` might fail.

**Potential Fix:**
```python
# More flexible matching
for app in summary.topAtRisk[:15]:
    first_name = app.get('name', '').split()[0] if app.get('name') else ''
    last_name = app.get('name', '').split()[-1] if app.get('name') else ''
    if (app.get('name', '') in answer or
        (first_name and last_name and first_name in answer and last_name in answer)):
        mentioned_names.append(app.get('name', ''))
```

### 2. Conversation History Might Not Persist

**Problem:** If database insert fails silently, conversation history won't be saved, so follow-up detection won't work.

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.ivy_conversation_messages
WHERE session_id = '<session_id_from_step_1>'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

Should show 2 messages (1 user, 1 assistant) with backend_candidates populated.

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Step 1: Pipeline query generates session_id and asks about intervention plans
- ‚úÖ Step 1: backend_candidates stored in conversation history (5 application_ids)
- ‚è≥ Step 2: "yes" detected as affirmative follow-up
- ‚è≥ Step 2: referenced_applicants extracted from last message (5 application_ids)
- ‚è≥ Step 2: Intervention plans generated with specific actions
- ‚è≥ Step 2: Plans formatted with emojis (üìû, ‚úâÔ∏è, üì±) and deadlines
- ‚è≥ Step 2: Asks "Would you like me to create these actions in your system?"

**Current Status:** Awaiting backend logs to confirm which hypothesis is correct.

**Recommended Action:** Start backend server and run `test_intervention_flow.sh`, then check logs.
